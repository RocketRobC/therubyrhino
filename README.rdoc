== DESCRIPTION:

Embed the Mozilla Rhino Javascript interpreter into Ruby

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Evaluate Javascript from with in Ruby
* Embed your Ruby objects into the Javascript world

== SYNOPSIS:

1. Javascript goes into Ruby
1. Ruby Objects goes into Javascript
1. Our shark's in the Javascript!


  include Rhino
# evaluate some simple javascript

  Rhino::Context.open do |context|
    context.evaljs("7 * 6") #=> 42
  end

# evaluate a ruby function from javascript
  
  Rhino::Context.open do |context|
    scope = context.init_standard_objects
    scope["say"] = function {|word, times| word * times}
    context.evaljs("say("Hello", 3)") #=> HelloHelloHello
  end

# Configure your embedding setup

  Rhino::Context.open do |context|
    # Make your standard objects (Object, String, etc...) immutable
    scope = context.init_standard_objects(:sealed => true)
    context.evaljs("Object.prototype.toString = function() {}") # this is an error!
    
    #Turn on Java integration from javascript (probably a bad idea)
    scope = context.init_standard_objects(:java => true)
    context.evaljs("java.lang.System.exit()") #it's dangerous!
  end
