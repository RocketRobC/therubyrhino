== DESCRIPTION:

Embed the Mozilla Rhino Javascript interpreter into Ruby

== FEATURES/PROBLEMS:

* Evaluate Javascript from with in Ruby
* Embed your Ruby objects into the Javascript world

== SYNOPSIS:

1. Javascript goes into Ruby
1. Ruby Objects goes into Javascript
1. Our shark's in the Javascript!

# evaluate some simple javascript

  Rhino::Context.open do |context|
    context.eval("7 * 6") #=> 42
  end

# evaluate a ruby function from javascript
  
  Rhino::Context.open do |context|
    context["say"] = function {|word, times| word * times}
    context.eval("say("Hello", 3)") #=> HelloHelloHello
  end

# Configure your embedding setup

  # Make your standard objects (Object, String, etc...) immutable
  Rhino::Context.open(:sealed => true) do |context|
    context.eval("Object.prototype.toString = function() {}") # this is an error!
  end
  
  #Turn on Java integration from javascript (probably a bad idea)
  Rhino::Context.open(:java => true) do |context|
    context.eval("java.lang.System.exit()") #it's dangerous!
  end
